                <p>
                    Bradley Helms has been a commercial photographer for the past 
                    18 years creating beautiful images for the Tailored Brands Studio, 
                    he has also worked with many brands including Ocean SF, 
                    Rosemary Roscoe Collection and on staff for the Men’s Wearhouse. 
                    At the Men’s Wearhouse he shot all of the brands including Levi, 
                    Docker, Joseph Aboud and many more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Brad began shooting photographs for events and music festivals 
                    and then moved into corporate events. He has always loved capturing 
                    beautiful images of both people, clothing and products. Since then he 
                    has specialized in portraits, wedding, special events, and again, 
                    fashion and clothing. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Brad grew up in Roseville and has been passionate about photography since he was young. 
                    He has been local to the Bay Area for the past 20 years where he has raised his family. 
                    He is down to earth and is as comfortable capturing the precious moments of people's 
                    lives as he is doing commercial photography.
